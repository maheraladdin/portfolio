        From my early passion for programming with Visual Basic in middle
        school, I've grown into a full-stack JavaScript and TypeScript developer
        with expertise in Next.js, the MERN stack, and Expo. Along the way, Iâ€™ve
        earned certifications from FreeCodeCamp, Udemy, and Udacity, as well as
        an Atlassian Project Management certificate. My portfolio includes
        notable projects like Taskify, a project management tool, and Suoq.net,
        an Arabic online classifieds platform. I approach every challenge with a
        systematic mindset and value honesty above all. Looking ahead, I aim to
        establish my own tech company and contribute to industry innovation,
        embracing the motto "anything is better than nothing."
